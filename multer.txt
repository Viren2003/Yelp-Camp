Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency.

NOTE: Multer will not process any form which is not multipart (multipart/form-data)

Multer adds a body object and a file or files object to the request object. The body object contains the values of the text fields of the form, the file or files object contains the files uploaded via the form.

Don't forget the enctype="multipart/form-data" in your form.

we have to specify the field name which is according to form so if we specify that then we can upload files.

like we upload img so we set that feildname as img like this upload.single('image')
